This library is based on software developed by David Kopec as code with the book
Classic Computer Science Problems In Java (c) Manning.com - 2020

The original source code can be found at https://github.com/davecom/ClassicComputerScienceProblemsInJava

I've added some convenience methods, removed use of null, and added unit tests, with the
purpose to use the library for solving generic Java puzzles...
